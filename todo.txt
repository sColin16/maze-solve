-- Clean up the code and comment it - its pretty messy in some places
-- Block maze editing while a solve is occuring
-- Automatically reset the solve when the maze is modified
-- Draw the tiles that were explored as part of the draw maze function
-- Allow step-by-step marking of the maze?
-- Add a function to make a maze solvable
-- Draw the maze as an image so that it takes less time for large mazes
-- Maze solver should push information to the control handler or vice versa
    becuase the pause button is still showing after a completed solve
-- Extend the controls to a more general controls library
-- Add experiment functionality, and maybe create some sort of library
    for creating those experiments easily
-- reset the coordinate that a solve start when you change the size between solves
